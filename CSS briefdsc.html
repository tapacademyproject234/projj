    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of <br>
        making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this <br>
        independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, <br>
        spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. <br>
        CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser. <br>

        While HTML uses tags, CSS uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the <br>
        presentation of an HTML document.
