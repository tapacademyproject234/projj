    <h1>CLOUD COMPUTING</h1>
    <P>Understanding the types of cloud computing resources can be time-consuming and costly. <br> 
        Enterprises need to buy physical servers and other infrastructure through procurement processes <br>
        that can take months, and support the architecture of cloud computing. <br>
        The acquired systems require a physical space, typically a specialized room with sufficient power and cooling. <br>
        After configuring and deploying the systems, enterprises need expert personnel to manage them. <br>

        This long process is difficult to scale when demand spikes or business expands. <br>
        Enterprises can acquire more computing resources than needed, ending up with low utilization numbers.</P>
