    <h1>JAVA</h1>
    
    <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. <br>
         It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled <br>
         Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. <br>
         Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. <br>
         Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications. <br>

        JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. <br>
        It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. <br>
        It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, <br>
        object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. <br> 
        A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. <br> 
        Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++. <br>
        
        History: Javaâ€™s history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991. <br>
        James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated the Java language in 1991. <br>
        Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0. It provides no-cost -run-times on popular platforms. <br>
        Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly comply with its specifications. <br>
        With the arrival of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.</p>
