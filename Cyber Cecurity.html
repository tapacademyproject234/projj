    <h1>CyberSecurity</h1>
    <p>As the boundaries of business continue to expand beyond the organization—with the help of accelerated digitization, <br>
        increased connectivity and migration to cloud—it’s critical that security is embedded throughout your business environment. <br>
         Being holistic in your approach to security gives your company the ability and confidence to scale and more agility <br>
         when it comes to adapting to any future impacts. In the face of potential cyber risk, resilience is key. <br> 
         Companies that build security into their business ecosystems by design, rather than by adding it as an afterthought, <br>
         are giving themselves the greatest opportunities to operate confidently in today’s evolving threat landscape. <br>
         The security of supply chains is becoming an increasingly urgent issue for businesses. <br>
         We know that as many as four in ten cyber attacks are now thought to originate in the extended supply chain, not the enterprise itself. <br>
         When it comes to cloud, being secure by design is crucial. <br>
         Not only does this accelerate a company’s resilience, cloud security is also important for business because it enables better outcomes.</p>
