            <h1>JAVA</h1>
            
            <p>JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle. <br>
               It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming <br>
               It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.</p>

            <h1>HTML</h1>
           
            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup. <br>
             HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. <br>
             A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.</p>

                <h1>CSS</h1>
           
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. <br>
                    CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. <br>
                    It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. <br>
                    CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.</p>

            <h1>JAVA SCRIPT</h1>
       
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. <br> 
                It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. <br>
                While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.</p>
